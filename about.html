<p>My summer vaction of 2013 was fun and funny.There was alot of friends that came over and alot of pranks.When we first got there my dad's car was broken and he was getting it fixed by his friend.His friend had a son that was at our house his name was Robert but we called him RJ.</p> 
<p>After we hungout with him for a while we were friends with him and we started playing video games.We got bored and told out cousin to comeover.</p>
